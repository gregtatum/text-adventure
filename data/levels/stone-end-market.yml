      You are standing at the Stone End docks. To the south, a city guard stands in
      a guard post, blocking the entrance to the docks. You can see The Torbay anchored
      in the port, the ship you came in on. The rowboat that brought you in from the
      ship is tied up on the docks. The sailors are nowhere to be seen.

      To the north the city awaits.

        targets: [guard post, post]

      To the north the city begins to open up. A sailor from the ship is chatting up
      a woman in a worn but colorful dress.

      The docks can be seen to the south. A forest of masts poke out from the bay. Smaller
      boats can be seen shuffling people to the busy port.
