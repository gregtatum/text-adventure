    coord: [12, 8, 0]
    description: |
      You are standing at the Stone End docks. To the south, a city guard stands in
      a guard post, blocking the entrance to the docks. You can see The Torbay anchored
      in the port, the ship you came in on. The rowboat that brought you in from the
      ship is tied up on the docks. The sailors are nowhere to be seen.

      To the north the city awaits.
    actions:
      - verb: Look
        targets: [guard post, post]
        value: The guard post is well worn. It looks old, but sturdy.

  - title: Stone End Market Road
    coord: [12, 7, 0]
    description: |
      The road you are on is surrounded by densely packed houses. A sailor from the ship
      is chatting up a woman in a worn, but colorful dress.

      To the north the city begins to open up.

      The docks can be seen to the south. A forest of masts poke out from the bay. Smaller
      boats can be seen shuffling people to the busy port.
    actions:
      - verb: Talk
        targets: [sailor]
        value: |
            The sailor responds, "I found her first. Go away."
      - verb: Talk
        targets: [woman]
        value: |
            The woman winks at you and says, "Hey sweetheart. Come back later, this one
            shouldn't take too long. He's freshly caught from the sea."
      - verb: Look
        targets: [sailor]
        value: |
            The sailor was on your ship. You don't know his name, but your not surprised
            to see him here. He has his hand on his belt purse. You listen in to the
            conversation for a moment, but your ears turn red with what the sailor is
            saying.
      - verb: Look
        targets: [woman]
        value: |
            The woman has heavy caked makeup on. Her dress is purple with a frayed
            hem. There is lace. So much lace... well, spilling out of everywhere.

    description: |
      You stand in front of a gate. Two guards stand there, pikes in hand. Over the gate
      hangs a festive hand painted banner.
    actions:
      - verb: Talk
        targets: [guard]
        value: |
            The guard looks bored. "Move along. The market's open, but mind your wallet.
            You look like you are new in town. The market is only open today, so get your
            buying done today."
      - verb: Look
        targets: [banner]
        value: The banner says "Stone End Market".
